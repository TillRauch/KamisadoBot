## Kamisado

[Kamisado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamisado) Game in Python. 
The game can be started by running
```bash 
python gui.py 
```
There is also a Computer-Engine to play against. It uses simple Alpha-Beta Pruning and a custom-built evaluation-function of board-states. Enable it by setting the variable `PLAY_WITH_BOT` to `True` in `gui.py`.
